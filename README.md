# Tap Room - Independent Project
#### React Fundamentals for Epicodus, 2/14/20
#### By Celeste Renee Morton
## Description:
The concept for this project is to build a website using React that displays a tap room where a bar or kombucha store can track their kegs.

## Component Structure
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Celesterenee7/tap-room/master/public/structure.png)

## User Stories:
* As a patron, I want to see a list/menu of all available kegs. For each keg, I need to see its name, brand, price and alcoholContent (or perhaps something like flavor for a kombucha store).
* As an employee, I want to fill out a form when I tap a new keg to add it to the list. (Don't worry about authenticating employee user accounts yet.)
* As an employee, I want the option to edit a keg's properties after entering them just in case I make a mistake.
* As a patron and/or employee, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg. (Hint: A full keg has roughly 124 pints).
* As an employee, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1.
* As an employee, I want to be able to see kegs with less than 10 pints left so I can be ready to change them.
* As a patron, I want to have kegs prices to be color-coded for easy readability. Perhaps based on their price (greater or less than $5 per pint, perhaps) or the particular style of beer or kombucha.
* As a patron, I want to use the alcohol content property to display stronger beers differently than weaker beers.
